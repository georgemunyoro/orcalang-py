# Comments

Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to document the code. They can be used to explain the code, to make it more readable and to prevent execution of code. There is only one type of comment in Orca, the single line comment. It starts with `//` and ends at the end of the line.

```orca
// This is a comment
```
